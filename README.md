## Project Details
This is a MVP Design based on the requirements of test

## Future Enhancements
`Socket.io Polling` - Currently the project is designed to make the API request from UI and get data. Since this is a scenario where we need data from server continously at regular interval, Socket.io Polling can be used. In Socket.io Polling, once a request has been initiated from UI to server, the server will automatically keep sending data at specified intervals and the UI won't have to request for data.

`Filter and Sort` - Filtering and sorting can be added that will provide a better user experience and will give the capability to only view selected data

`Pagination` - Pagination can be added so that only a limited number of data is displayed on the page
